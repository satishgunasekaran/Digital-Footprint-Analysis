3 weeks ago,"Other: Poll, Shared Post, etc","Have you heard about Tholpavakoothu (தோல்பாவைக்கூத்து)?KPRIET's Drama Club is very excited about stage drama and mime, but they also exhibit interest in learning about the history of dramas or feature films, as well as the various cultural stage arts practices used by Indians. Here are the few details they provide regarding shadow puppetry.It also known as Tholpavakoothu, is a form of temple art that is popular in the Bhagavathy temples in Kerala's Palakkad district and neighboring areas.The puppets, known as Tholppava (Thol-leather and Pava-puppet), are manipulated by strings, and a background row of oil lamps helps to project their shadows onto a screen. The Ramayana, an Indian epic, is where the Tholppavakoothu performance takes its story from. It used to be carefully performed over the course of 41 days. Adalpattu is a prose and poetry hybrid that serves as the performance's narrative.Tholppavas are made of the skin of deer and the puppet forms are made by making small holes in the leather that is then attached vertically to a bamboo stick.Accompanying instruments include Ezhupara, Chenda, and Maddalam. The artists have to undergo several years of rigorous training to master this art form. The puppetry is staged on a special structure in temple premises called Koothumadam.Two Tholpavakoothu puppets from the district are on display at a prestigious international exhibition being held at Chuncheon in South Korea. The puppets of Hanuman and Ravana will be boasting India’s long tradition of shadow puppetry for 10 months at the Chuncheon Puppet Museum, Korea. The year-long exhibition of puppets is being held as part of the 2022 general assembly of the International Association of Puppet-Friendly Cities popular by the French acronym AVIAMA (Association des Villes Amies de la Marionnette). Signing the contract with the Chuncheon authorities, Tholpavakoothu exponent Sajeesh Pulavar said that it was a recognition not only for the traditional temple art of shadow puppetry from the State but also for the entire country which has given the world the epics of Ramayana and Mahabharat.The Korean authorities have given the following description for the Tholpavakoothu puppets displayed at the museum: “Tholpavakoothu is a traditional shadow puppet theatre in Kerala, southwestern India. It is mainly made of deer and goat skins, and two sticks are used to control the puppet.”Apart from Kerala, States such as Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha too have traditional puppet theatres. If it is Tholpavakoothu in Kerala, it is Tholu Bommalatam in Tamil Nadu, Tholu Bommalatta in Andhra Pradesh, Thogalu Gombeyatta in Karnataka and Raban Chhaya in Odisha. Although Kerala has another puppet art named Pavakkathakali too, it remains less popular.#tholpavakoothu #tradition #culture #drama #puppet #history #tamilnadu #kerala #museum #Chuncheon #korea #bommalatam #art #deer #historical #odisha #temple #exhibit #korean #french Courtesy: The Hindu

According to tradition, the devas and gods plotted to overthrow Mahabali because they were envious of his fame and dominance. They despatched Vamana, a tiny Brahmin, to Earth where he crushed Mahabali to patala (netherworld). Vamanan requested from the kind Mahabali three feet of land as his wish. Mahabali consented to grant Vamana's request because it is considered disrespectful to refuse presents to Brahmin. Vamana measured the universe with his first two feet, leaving no room for his third foot. In order to fulfill the wish, Mahabali offered his own head in the position of his third feet.But after seeing Mahabali's kindness, Vishnu granted the king's lone request to return once a year to his kingdom and citizens. Every year in Kerala, Onam is observed to commemorate Mahabali's return home.Extending heartiest greetings on this auspicious occasion of Onam.May the colours & brightness of the festival bring joy, good health & immense prosperity to your lives.Happy Onam!#health #kindness #administration #Mahabali #onam #happyonam #kerala #tamilnadu #coimbatore #india #festival #brightness #vamanan
